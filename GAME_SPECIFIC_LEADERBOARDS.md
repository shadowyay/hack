# Game-Specific Leaderboards Implementation

## ✅ **ANSWER: YES, the system DOES store highest scores for each game in the database**

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

The system had all the backend infrastructure ready but was missing **score submission from individual games**. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅ 
- User model has `stats.highScores.duel`, `stats.highScores.chase`, `stats.highScores.tracking`
- Each high score stores: `score`, `accuracy`, `reactionTime`, `timestamp`

### 2. **Backend API** ✅
- `POST /performance/save-result` - Saves game results and updates high scores
- `GET /leaderboard/:mode` - Gets leaderboard for specific game mode
- `GET /leaderboard/user/:userId/:mode` - Gets user rank for specific mode

### 3. **Frontend Leaderboards** ✅ 
- Game-specific leaderboard tabs (Duel Masters, Chase Champions, Tracking Legends)
- Individual game stats and rankings
- User-specific performance tracking per game

### 4. **Score Submission Integration** ✅ **NEWLY ADDED**

#### **Tracking Game** (`src/components/game2/TrackingGame.tsx`)
- ✅ Added score submission when analysis screen loads
- ✅ Submits to backend with mode: 'tracking'
- ✅ Calculates accuracy, reaction time, strategy rating

#### **Chase Game** (`src/components/game3/OutlawChaseGame.tsx`) 
- ✅ Added score submission when analysis screen loads
- ✅ Submits to backend with mode: 'chase'
- ✅ Uses survival time, combo, accuracy metrics

#### **Duel Game** (`src/components/game/DuelScene.ts`)
- ✅ Already working - dispatches GAME_END event
- ✅ GameScenePage listens and calls onGameEnd
- ✅ App.tsx saves to backend with mode: 'duel'

### 5. **Enhanced Leaderboard UI** ✅ **IMPROVED**

#### **Game-Specific Features:**
- 🎯 Mode-specific titles and descriptions
- 🎨 Color-coded themes for each game type
- 📊 Game-specific stats summary (highest score, best accuracy, fastest time)
- 🏆 Enhanced user rank display with game context
- 🎮 "Challenge This Mode" buttons to play games directly

#### **Game Mode Information:**
- **Duel Masters** 🤠 - "Fast Draw Champions" (Red theme)
- **Chase Champions** 🐎 - "High-Speed Pursuit Leaders" (Blue theme)  
- **Tracking Legends** 🎯 - "Precision Masters" (Green theme)

### 6. **User Stats Dashboard** ✅ **ENHANCED**
- Individual performance breakdown per game mode
- Overall stats comparison across all three games
- Best scores, accuracy, and reaction times per mode
- Visual indicators for played vs unplayed modes

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Score Submission Flow:**
1. **Player completes game** → Game calculates final stats
2. **Analysis screen loads** → `useEffect` triggers score submission
3. **Backend receives data** → Updates `user.stats.highScores[mode]` if new high score
4. **Database updated** → New score appears in game-specific leaderboard
5. **Achievement check** → Unlocks achievements if applicable

### **Leaderboard Display:**
1. **User selects game mode** → Frontend fetches mode-specific leaderboard
2. **Backend queries** → `User.find().sort({stats.highScores.mode.score: -1})`
3. **Results displayed** → Top players for that specific game mode
4. **User rank shown** → Player's position in that game's leaderboard

## 🚀 **Testing The Implementation**

### **To verify scores are being saved:**

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd src/backend && node app.js
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Play each game mode:**
   - Complete a Tracking game → Check console for "Score saved successfully"
   - Complete a Chase game → Check console for "Chase game score saved successfully"  
   - Complete a Duel game → Should save automatically via existing flow

4. **Check leaderboards:**
   - Go to Leaderboard page
   - Switch between game modes
   - Verify your scores appear in the correct game-specific leaderboard

### **Database Verification:**
Query MongoDB directly to see the stored scores:
```javascript
db.users.findOne({username: "your_username"}, {
  "stats.highScores": 1,
  "gameHistory": 1
})
```

## 📊 **Data Structure**

### **User.stats.highScores:**
```javascript
{
  duel: {
    score: 1500,
    accuracy: 85.5,
    reactionTime: 320,
    timestamp: "2025-08-23T..."
  },
  chase: {
    score: 2200,
    accuracy: 78.2,
    reactionTime: 850,
    timestamp: "2025-08-23T..."
  },
  tracking: {
    score: 1800,
    accuracy: 92.1,
    reactionTime: 450,
    timestamp: "2025-08-23T..."
  }
}
```

### **Game History:**
```javascript
gameHistory: [
  {
    mode: "tracking",
    score: 1800,
    accuracy: 92.1,
    reactionTime: 450,
    strategyRating: 88,
    duration: 120000,
    timestamp: "2025-08-23T..."
  }
  // ... more games
]
```

## ✅ **Conclusion**

**YES - The system now fully stores and displays highest scores for each of the 3 specific games:**

1. 🤠 **Duel Masters** - Fast draw duels
2. 🐎 **Chase Champions** - High-speed outlaw pursuits  
3. 🎯 **Tracking Legends** - Precision animal tracking

Each game has its own leaderboard, user rankings, and performance tracking, with scores automatically saved to the database when games are completed.
